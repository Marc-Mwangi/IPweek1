The independent project required me to make a photography website.
Please start with the index.html file to start at home page.
The link at the footer of the second page will lead you back to the home page.

I decided to give the project a portfolio feel by giving it a more objective approach. I designed my website imagining I was to satisfy a clients needs. Hence that is why I settled for a tour photography site. Tourism which once brought in a lot of money into our economy has been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. I attempted to create a lab based solution for this while still satisfying the projects instructions.
ALSO 
Whats there not to love about the BIG 5?
Hopefully this project will be a reminder of all the forgotten treasures of this country .
I took some creative liberty using an animated background for my landing page. Though it was both tideous and risky advancing into unchartered grounds, I enjoyed every part ofthe learning experience.
I have attached all the relevant media files.
