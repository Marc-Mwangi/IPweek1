### 30/9/2021
## Description
This is a custom designed photography website for a tour and wildlife photography website. The site starts at the landing page with a breif welcoming text and the portfolio button leads to a sample of pictures related to the service.

## Setup/Installation
All the code is publicly viewable. You can clone the project locally and to view it you can use you browser application. Preferably Chrome browser due to certain format compatibilities.

## Technology used
Visual studio was the prefered compiler for all the coding done. I got alot of techniques and ideas from online resources that combined helped me produce the final product you can now view.
